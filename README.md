**Artificial Biological Intelligence**

Information about the world comes in many diverse physical forms, including electromagnetic radiation, sound waves, chemical identity and concentration, force, temperature, and time. In addition, measurements of an entity's various internal states contribute proprioceptive and several kinds of interoceptive information. Atop these primary data are further layers of measurement and interpretation, such as size, texture, orientation, position and number, and ultimately, memories, abstractions, valuations, goals, and feelings.

Information alone is inconsequential without effectors to guide its collection. Actions range from modulation and regulation through to secretion and movement in animals, and often communication, creative expression and planning. Actions can be driven by reflexes, instincts and contextual interpretation, with an agency that is considered and appropriate.

However daunting the task of amalgamating such a disparate collection of data sources may appear at first glance, sensory data integration and interpretation, as well as cognitive control, are solved problems in biological systems, in the form of the metazoan nervous system. This fact may not reveal any obvious course of action for implementing a mind *in silico*, but it does offer the promise of feasibility. The mind is an evolutionarily tractacle invention, and as such must be constructed using biologically plausible principles. In evolution, complexity and sophistication can only be achieved by a combinatorial elaboration of the simple mechanisms that are within its reach.

*Syntheta*, a system of artificial general intelligence, was engineered to represent all information in a simple and universal format, to innovate by repurposing duplicated modules of standard design, and to achieve stability and robustness through feedback and regulation.

Please visit this page periodically. Syntheta's documentation will be released in stages, as will its code (written in portable C++17). Feel free to use the utilities in SourceCode/Common/ for other projects as well.

I am interested in finding collaborators and contributors.
