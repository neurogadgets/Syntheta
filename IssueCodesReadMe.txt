## = for later consideration
### = non-blocking to-do
###! = needs attention (priority to-do)
###!! = known bug (priority blocking to-do)

###? = needs R&D

###T = needs testing
###TL = logic needs testing
###TP = policy to revisit/test/optimize
###O = may be optimized
###D = debug code


Note: to grep for these, one needs to escape the exclamation mark.
e.g.,
grep "###\!" *.cpp

If desired, prepend the ##... with a number indicating the version to which the to-do applies, e.g. 1##... can mean the current version, 2##... can mean subsequent versions to be resolved later.
